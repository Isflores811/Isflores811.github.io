    <section id="page-info">
      <p>My interest in web development blossomed when I realized that crafting websites could be both an enjoyable and rewarding career path. I started out learning by immersing myself in the fundamental building blocks that hold websites together: HTML and CSS. My goal was to not only understand how websites function but also to master the art of structuring web pages effectively. To put my skills to the test and elevate my capabilities, I set out to create three distinct websites including my portfolio, each serving as a pivotal milestone in my learning journey. With each project, I incorporated new features and techniques, making my websites more responsive and user-friendly.
        These projects provided me with opportunities to explore various design concepts, layouts, and interactive elements, progressively shaping me into the web developer I am today. However, I am fully aware that my journey in web development is just beginning. I am driven to prove to myself that I can excel in this field. Here's to many more years dedicated to perfecting my craft!</p>

          <p>This website revolves around one of my biggest passions â€”Traveling. I wanted to create a website that felt like an open invitation to explore the world. I decided to play the role of a travel advisor and give advice on some aspects of putting together a trip. I tried to give the site a casual look inviting whomever to contact me with questions about traveling! I wanted this site to be a playground for all the HTML and CSS tricks I'd learned. I was on a mission to make it visually appealing, and easy to navigate for any digitally inclined traveler to use. Now, I knew this wasn't the end of my coding journey, but it was one of my last hurrahs with just HTML and CSS. I was ready to dive into other coding languages for future projects. So, I went all in, and It was surprisingly smooth sailing. Even any coding problems that arose was dealt with more efficiently compared to when I first started coding. The site came out exactly how I pictured it, unhinged and totally me. It was like giving my creativity free rein.Working on a site all about something I'm super passionate about was a great experience and fueled my determination to master web development. The journey continues!</p>

          <p>My second website idea was a real estate agency, but not your typical one. Nope, this one was all about expert tradespeople selling houses to eager customers. I thought it was a good idea since who wouldn't want to buy a house that your realtor is also a certified tradesman! Now, for this project, I was all about flexing my CSS muscles. I mean, who knew CSS could be so much fun to navigate around. Using css animations and transitions in particular are my favorite to mess around with! I might've been working with limited knowledge, but that didn't stop me from feeling like a CSS wizard. I also decided to jazz up the website by adding some of my Photoshop creations using Adobe Creative Suit. It felt like I was giving the whole thing a personal touch. One thing I was pretty happy about was how the page structure came together. It might not have been perfect, but it's amazing to have an idea and work it out into a working web page. Looking back, it might've been a bit of a wild idea, but it was all part of the learning journey. And honestly, I'm proud of how it turned out, quirks and all!

          <p>I began my web development adventure with 'The Loaded Fry'. A website for a restaurant idea revolved around one of the best comfort foods loaded fries. Its pretty crazy looking back at my first project and seeing how far I've come in a short amount of time! One of my main goals of piecing this website together was making sure the structure of my html was right. While also using the right tags to neatly piece everything together for a neat looking syntax and code. Styling with css my look basic on the web page but at the time I was just extremely proud that all stuck together perfectly! While working on the code for my website I also came across the need to work in graphic design, this came about with the need to make a menu for my restaurant. Using Canva to piece together a suitable menu was an easy choice with how many options they have that helped spark a fun looking menu. All in all this being my first website I'm extremely proud of the finished product, not to mention hungry for loaded fries haha.</p>
